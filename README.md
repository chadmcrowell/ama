# DevOps, Containers & Azure Ask Me Anything!

## [Ask a question](../../issues/new) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Read questions](../../issues)

I get a lot of questions in my courses, email & DMs. This way, anyone can read the answer! 

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

**Note:**[I have courses on DevOps, Azure, Kubernetes, and GitHub here](https://cmcrowell.com/post/courses/)

### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered
- Use a succinct title and description
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker
- Tech support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow
- Be civil and polite
